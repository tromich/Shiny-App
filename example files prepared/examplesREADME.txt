These are sample files provided for use with the program. They are derived from LANDSAT data
obtained from the US government via EarthExplorer in March 2022.

The .gri files are the ones that should actually be uploaded to the program.

Example Simple Output 1 and Example Simple Output 2 are extraction results for the same single day
of LANDSAT-7 data. They differ in that Example Simple Output 1 uses the extraction program's
default latitude and longitude coordinates, while Example Simple Output 2 uses a lower minimum
longitude and higher maximum latitude than the default.
